# Asynchoronous - FIFO
7 days challege to complete this project

DAY - 1 
Started working on an Asynchronous FIFO (Clock Domain Crossing) project in Verilog HDL.

Recent progress includes studying the fundamental principles of FIFO operation—such as pointer-based buffering, circular memory behavior, and full/empty condition detection—along with a review of Clifford E. Cummings’ research on asynchronous FIFO design and CDC methodologies to establish a strong theoretical foundation prior to RTL implementation.
